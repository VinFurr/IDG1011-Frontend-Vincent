<p>24. Create a step by step tutorial on how to create a cronjob that prints “Task scheduled at” +
DATE. Cronjob is scheduled every 30 minutes on today’s date (only today).</p><p class=answers>
  - (assumes that you already have downloaded ubuntu and are in the root)<br>

  1. Type and enter: <br>
       <code>crontab -e</code><br><br>

  2. Navigate to the bottom.<br><br>

  3. Check the date for today.<br><br>

  4. Type:<br>
     <code>0,30 * [day] [month] *</code>
     where you change [day] and [month] to the number that corresponds to todays date.
     Example: todays date is 16th november, the day=16 and month=11. Then you would have to type "0,30 * 16 11 *"
     if you are still unsure if this is right, to to https://crontab.guru to see what the numbers means<br><br>

    5. On the same line, type: <br>
     <code>echo "Task scheduled at $(date)"</code>

       this is basically whats needed, but it is not specified where it should print shis text.<br><br>

    6. to print it in a text, type:<br>
      <code> >> /home/[USERNAME]/[filename].txt</code>
     just change [USERNAME] with your username and [filename]with the name you want to give it.
     Example: my username is "vinfurr" and i name my .txt file to print. so i should type:
    <code> >> /home/vinfurr/print.txt</code>   <br>

       So far the example code line looks like this:<br>
       <code>0,30 * 16 11 * echo "Task scheduled at $(date)" >> /home/vinfurr/print.txt</code><br>

       Note: if you want the .txt file to be in another location, you can do that too. <br> Just specify the path for where you want the .txt file to be<br><br>

    7. Press Ctrl and O on the keyboard, save and then press Ctrl and X to exit<br><br>

    8. Create the .txt file in the same path that you specified in the crontab:
     <code>nano [filename].txt</code><br><br>

    9. Press Ctrl and O on the keyboard, save and then press Ctrl and X to exit<br><br>

   10. Type and enter:<br>
       <code>service cron status</code><br>

       if it says the cron is not running, then enter this command:<br>
       <code>service cron start</code><br>
       and the the .txt file will be written at every minute 0 and 30 during that day.<br>

       if you wish to stop the job, then enter this command and you are done:<br>
       <code>service cron stop</code><br><br>
   11. If you want to read the .txt file, enter this command:<br>
       <code>cat [filename].txt</code><br>
       Remember to change [filename] with the name you have chosen for the .txt file</p>


<p>25. Create a script that takes an input (letter or number) that will display the answer of a question.
The script should when started list a menu for the user with the different questions that can be
chosen and which corresponding letter the user will have to give as input to display the answer of
the desired question. One of the possible inputs the user should be able to make is "q" for quitting
the script. The menu should also have a default case where all the items is displayed again, or no
changes is made if the user gives an invalid input. Hint: use a switch case to be able to handle the
menu. Each option in the menu should lead to an echo of the answer</p><p class=answers>
